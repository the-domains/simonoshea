description: 'You can 3D print plenty of things these days, from candy to a model of an asteroid. And now, with the help of a 3D printer, you can produce most of the parts for a pretty simple engine. Recently, German engineer Andreas Haeuser built a solar-powered Stirling engine using almost entirely 3D printed parts.'
