            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Solar-Powered Engine Can Be Made With A 3D Printer</h1><p>You can 3D print plenty of things these days, from candy to a model of an asteroid. And now, with the help of a 3D printer, you can produce most of the parts for a pretty simple engine. Recently, German engineer Andreas Haeuser built a solar-powered Stirling engine using almost entirely 3D printed parts.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd95eff288547489f1e0bf6bb3dea00a6531c985.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Passive Houses Get Good Graphic Explanation</h1><p>The New York Times has a great graphic explanation of the principles of the Passive House, "airtight buildings that use heat from appliances and even the occupants' bodies for warmth." The Times notes that while they are popular in Germany and Scandinavia, they have not caught on in the US, where it seems that the "green gizmo" approach of adding photovoltaics and heat pumps rules over simplicity and efficiency.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/39bf7cb8c4365a5552def999b544129d84a19195.jpg"></article>]]></description>
